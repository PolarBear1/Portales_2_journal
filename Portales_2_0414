1)Hackers getting in between you and the connection point so you are sending your info to the hacker which then 
they relay it on.Hackers may also use an unsecured wifi connection to distribute malware and if you allow file-sharing
on your moblie device you are basically just opening yourself to the malware the hacker has passed on with
tht wifi.

2)  You may use a VPN which encrypts your info if a hacker manages to get in between you and your connection point.This 
    option may not always be available for your general browsing.

    You may also use SSL connections which can be enabled with the option of "always use https" on frequently visited
    websites so you can still have your info encrypted from hackers.
    
    You will also want to turn off sharing because so you dont share any files that you want to keep secure
    
    Keep wifi off when you dont need it because you may never know if those wifi spots may be roaming with hackers or clean
    
3)VPN is a info encrypter so your information cant be easily readable for hackers.Since the hackers are lazy and want easy
jobs,they will most likely abandon that info because of its strong encription.This is especially useful when connecting to
business with wifi hotspots and un secure networks(not smart) so your personal info cant be stolen easily due to the 
strong encryption of the VPN.
