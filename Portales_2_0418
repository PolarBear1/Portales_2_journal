  Considering that we had the internet at our disposal, the grade i received is not as high as it could have 
possibly been but since I only use my command history then it is in the range of what my grade would be since it didnt have all
the commands i needed.When I tried to run some of the commands they printed an error so i couldnt rerun them.
