A disk image is a computer file containing the info of a disk volume

The command to make a disk image is DD

A disk partition is like a storage for filesysytems

A disk image has enough partitions for that 1 image which depends on the size of the image.

This can pose as a problem because if they get overritten, the image would get corupted.

To work with this you must make a backup of your disk so that if something gets corrupted you can always have a saved file 
If you dont have a backup you whould have a difficult time fixing your mistakes.
