Doing something at home does make you better at that thing you work on.

For linux it does not describe me because i dont have linux machine at home but i study what i can at home.

I am decent at independent problem solving because i try everything i can to solve a problem i encounter

I am not finished with the  2 partitions because my VM is not working properly
