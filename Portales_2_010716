1. By finding the first and last lines that contain information in the file "blorb" we can find the file header/footer

2. I go this output after i used the commands:
 
 icat df_0106.img:
 Missing image name and/or address
 usage: icat [-hrRsvV] [-f fstype] [-i imgtype] [-b dev_sector_size] [-o imgoffset] image [images] inum[-typ[-id]]
	-h: Do not display holes in sparse files
	-r: Recover deleted file
	-R: Recover deleted file and suppress recovery errors
	-s: Display slack space at end of file
	-i imgtype: The format of the image file (use '-i list' for supported types)
	-b dev_sector_size: The size (in bytes) of the device sectors
	-f fstype: File system type (use '-f list' for supported types)
	-o imgoffset: The offset of the file system in the image (in sectors)
	-v: verbose to stderr
	-V: Print version
	
	Gives options because we can access/have a the inode

To whom it may concearn:

I have the keys to your network.  Unless you do what I say, I will hold
you and your entire business ransom.

This is not a joke.

I have had enough of your mindless corporate piracy and will no longer stand for it. You will recieve another letter next week.  It will have a single bank account number and bank name.  I want you to deposit $50,000 in the account the day you receive the letter.  

Don't try anything, and dont contact the cops.  If you do, I will unleash a virus that will bring down your whole network and destroy your consumer's confidence.  

Don't mess with me on this!

			your WOrsT NighTMarEEE
			
I found it by using blkls and looking at the contents it gave me.
