for it manually


This PDF has all of the file types and their corresponding bit start
it aloso contains the grep and sort command with corresponding commands


Excel document 
find the begining  (D0 CF 11 E0 11 E0) using xxd image | grep ffd8
then we echo the result (echo=ibase16;LINE" | bc
next we xxd -s RESULT image | grep ffd9
then we echo "ibase=16;RESULTLINE" | bc 
net we echo "RESLUT1-RESULT2" and get RESULT3
finnaly we dd if=image of=carv skip=RESULT1 bs=1 count=RESULT3
then to look at the final product we xv carv to see the image

To find the other file types we do the same process but with its corresponding LINe and RESULTs
