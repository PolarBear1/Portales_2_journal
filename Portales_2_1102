Yesterday i tried to make a running VM but was not able to 

The error i encountered was that the df-kali was read only which prevented me from fixing my VM

I have also tried to get the VMs from my old computer to run but they where the VMs that didnt run and the ones that
did run are still are on my old computer because we were not able to get them due to them having spaces in the name
