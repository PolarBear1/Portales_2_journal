We locate the begining of an image file by using ffd8 with the grep command


First we search for a standard JPEG image.We search for the standard JPEG image by using the command xxd image.raw | grep ffd8

Then we bc to find the line. 

Using the value from that - we use ibase and the line number to convert line number to a decimal number.

For example, in the example from yesterday, we found the line number and converted it to decimal using the command ibase
xxd -s 21156 image_carve.raw | grep ffd9
echo "ibase=16;0006C74" | bc

Then to find the end of the file, we searched for ffd9 using the command xxd -s 21156 image_carve.raw | grep ffd9

Using that information, we find the number of bits, using the command bc command

Then using dd we can reconstruct the file using the commands  skip bs and count.
